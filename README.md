# Finanace-Report

In this project, I leveraged Power BI to perform an in-depth analysis of key financial metrics, including total sales, total items sold, gross sales, and profit by year. The project also involved extensive data cleaning to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the financial data prior to analysis. After cleaning and transforming the data, I created interactive dashboards to visualize key trends, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions based on reliable insights.

Key Metrics Analyzed:

   > Total Sales: Visualized overall sales to identify growth trends and seasonal fluctuations.

    > Total Items Sold: Assessed product demand and sales efficiency through interactive reports.

    > Gross Sales: Analyzed gross revenue for top-line performance insights.

     > Profit by Year: Presented year-over-year profit data to detect profitability trends.

Key Features of the Power BI Report:

    . Data Cleaning: Applied techniques such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing data formats to ensure data accuracy.

    . Interactive Dashboards: Enabled users to drill into specific metrics, such as sales per product category or profit per region.

    . Year-over-Year Comparisons: Visualized trends and shifts in profit and sales, providing actionable insights for future planning.
    

This project highlights my ability to clean and prepare financial data for analysis, then use Power BI to deliver powerful visual insights that guide business decisions and strategic planning.
